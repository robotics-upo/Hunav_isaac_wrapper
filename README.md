# **HuNav Isaac Wrapper**  

A standalone simulation wrapper for **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, integrating the **Human Navigation Simulator ([HuNavSim](https://github.com/robotics-upo/hunav_sim))** with **physics-based animations** and **ROS 2 teleoperation**.

---

### ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This repository is actively developed and subject to improvements.

### âœ… **Tested Configurations**  
- **ROS 2 Humble**  
- **Isaac Sim 4.2**  
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**

## ðŸ”¹ **Overview**  
**HuNav Isaac Wrapper** provides a **modular** framework for **human navigation simulation** (via the [HuNavSim](https://github.com/robotics-upo/hunav_sim)) in **Isaac Sim**, integrating **ROS 2** for teleoperation and **HuNavSim** for agent behavior. Key components include:

- **ROS 2 Integration** (`teleop_hunav_sim.py`) â€“ Handles `/cmd_vel` for robot teleoperation and synchronizes HuNavSim agents.  
- **Agent Management** (`hunav_manager.py`) â€“ Manages agent spawning, animations, physics, and obstacle detection via YAML configurations (`config/` folder).  
- **Animation System** â€“ Uses **AnimationGraph** for **walk/idle animations blending** and supports animation **retargeting**.
- **Scenario Loading** (`world_builder.py`) â€“ Loads USD scenarios from the `scenarios/` folder into the simulator stage.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Features**  

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - `world_builder.py` â€“ Loads USD scenarios.  
  - `hunav_manager.py` â€“ Manages agents, physics, and animations.  
  - `teleop_hunav_sim.py` â€“ Integrates ROS 2 teleoperation and initializes HuNavSim's workflow.
  - `animation_utils.py` â€“ Contains all animation-related utils.
  - `main.py` â€“ Entry point for the simulation.  

- **Animation System:**  
  - **AnimationGraph-based** animation blending for smooth walk/idle transitions:  
    - Uses an **AnimationGraph blend node**, driven by agent velocity, to dynamically transition between walk and idle animations.  
    - Ensures **fluid motion** by eliminating abrupt animation changes and maintaining consistency across loop boundaries.  
  - Supports **animation retargeting**, using **USD SkelAnimation** and the **Omni Anim Retargeting extension** to apply a single set of animation clips (e.g., walking, idle) originally designed for a **default NVIDIA biped skeleton** to multiple character models.  

- **Configurable Agent Spawning:**  
  - YAML files (inside `config/`) define **initial positions, goals, social force model (SFM) parameters and behaviors**.  

- **Social Simulation & Teleoperation:**  
  - **ROS 2 teleoperation** via `/cmd_vel` for real-time robot control.  
  - **HuNavSim agent management** for social-aware navigation.  

- **Obstacle Detection:**  
  - **PhysX raycasts** (implemented in `hunav_manager.py`) detect obstacles for **HuNavSimâ€™s** navigation logic.

## ðŸ”¹ **Requirements**
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**
- [**HuNavSim**](https://github.com/robotics-upo/hunav_sim)
- [**NVIDIA Isaac Sim**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html#) (Tested on version 4.2.0) 

  
- **Python 3.8+**  

- **ROS 2 (**only tested on [ROS Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)**)**

## ðŸ”¹ **Installation and Usage**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/Hunav_isaac_wrapper.git
cd Hunav_isaac_wrapper
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

- Launch Isaac Simâ€™s Python interpreter or set up the environment so that all Omniverse APIs are available.
- **The provided startup bash script (`startup_hunav_isaac.sh`) should automatically load the correct environment.**


### 3. ROS 2 Setup

Ensure that ROS 2 is installed and sourced before launching the simulation.

### 4. Configure Your Agents and Scene

The map name and agent configuration file are set in `main.py`. 

#### Agents Configuration
- Edit the YAML file in the `config/` folder (e.g., `agents_1.yaml`) to specify agent parameters such as:
  - **Initial pose**: Set the starting position.
  - **Goals**: Define the waypoints or destinations for each agent.
  - **SFM weights**: Configure social force model parameters.
  - **Behavior**: Set the behavior type and associated parameters.

#### Scene Setup
- Place your USD scenario file (e.g., `empty_world.usd`) in the `scenarios/` folder.
- A **sample scenario** (`sample_scenario.usd`) has been added with obstacles to better illustrate agent dynamics. **Ensure to decompress the file before usage**.

### 5. Launch the Simulation

Run the startup script:

```bash
./startup_hunav_isaac.sh
```

This script will:
- Launch Isaac Sim (with a GUI unless headless mode is specified).
- Load the specified scenario.
- Spawn agents based on the YAML configuration.
- Apply physics, animations, and initialize ROS 2 communication for enabling HuNavSim and robot teleoperation.

### 6. Teleoperation and Simulation

#### Teleoperation
- Publish ROS 2 Twist messages to `/cmd_vel` to control the robot (e.g., a Jetbot).

#### Simulation
- The simulation continuously updates agent positions, behaviors and animations on every physics step.

## ðŸ”¹ **Troubleshooting**

**(*) In the case of using agent models other than the provided ones**
### Agent Orientation (*)
- If agents appear horizontal rather than vertical, adjust the rotation applied in the script (e.g., modify the quaternion calculation in `hunav_manager.initialize_agents()`'s `init_rot` parameter and/or `hunav_manager._update_agents()`).

### Retargeting Errors (*)
- Verify that the default source biped prim is correctly loaded at `/World/biped_demo`.
- Ensure that the target agents have a valid **skeleton** (use the `findSkeletonPath` method for debugging).
- Confirm that the extension `omni.anim.retarget.core` is enabled.

### AnimationGraph Issues
- If AnimationGraph is not applying correctly, verify that it is correctly assigned to the agent's **SkelRoot** and that transformations are applied properly.

### ROS 2 Connectivity
- Make sure ROS 2 is running and that the `/compute_agents` service is active.
