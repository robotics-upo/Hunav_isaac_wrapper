## üîπ **Setup Guide**

### 1. Repository Setup

#### **Option 1: Direct Clone (Recommended)**

This project is structured as a complete ROS2 workspace:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/Hunav_isaac_wrapper
cd Hunav_isaac_wrapper

# Install ROS2 dependencies
sudo apt install ros-humble-geometry-msgs ros-humble-nav-msgs ros-humble-sensor-msgs ros-humble-tf2-ros

# Install Python dependencies
pip install pyyaml numpy matplotlib

# Build the workspace 
colcon build

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash
```

#### **Option 2: Add to Existing ROS2 Workspace**

If you want to integrate this into an existing ROS2 workspace:

```bash
cd ~/your_ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/Hunav_isaac_wrapper.git

# Move the package contents to your workspace
cp -r hunav_isaac_wrapper/src/* .
rm -rf hunav_isaac_wrapper

# Build your workspace
cd ~/your_ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select hunav_isaac_wrapper
source install/setup.bash
```

#### **Additional Dependencies**

You'll also need to install HuNavSim in case you haven't already:

```bash
# In your ROS2 workspace src directory
git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/hunav_sim.git
cd .. && colcon build 
```

### 2. Isaac Sim Installation

Make sure you have **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** installed. Follow the [Isaac Sim Installation Guide](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/install_workstation.html).

### 3. Configure Isaac Sim Extensions

To ensure all required dependencies are active, replace the existing `isaacsim.exp.base.kit` file from your Isaac Sim installation with the one provided in this repository:

```bash
# After cloning this repository
cp src/isaacsim.exp.base.kit ~/isaacsim/apps/
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This file ensures that essential extensions (e.g., animation retargeting, ROS 2 bridge) are preloaded at startup.

### 4. ROS 2 Setup

Ensure ROS 2 Humble is installed and sourced:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

### 5. Configure Your Scene, Agents, and Robot

The simulation setup is configured through the interactive launcher, which provides a menu-driven interface to select the world, agent configuration, and robot model.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Scene Setup

The repository includes multiple pre-configured USD files in `src/worlds/`:

- `warehouse.usd`: Industrial layout with shelves and various obstacles
- `hospital.usd`: Medical environment with corridors and rooms
- `office.usd`: Workspace with desks and conference areas
- `empty_world.usd`: A minimal open environment for testing

#### üßç Agents Configuration

Each world is paired with a YAML file in `src/scenarios/` that defines the HuNavSim agents:

- **Available configuration files:**
  - `agents_warehouse.yaml` ‚Üí for `warehouse.usd`
  - `agents_hospital.yaml` ‚Üí for `hospital.usd`

- **Each YAML file lets you configure:**
  - **Initial pose**: Define starting positions of each agent.
  - **Goals**: Set destination coordinates or waypoints per agent.
  - **SFM weights**: Tune the social force model for realistic crowd behavior.
  - **Behavior type**: Choose how agents behave.

**Always pair the world with its corresponding agent YAML to avoid misaligned goals or initial agent positions**.

#### ü§ñ Robot Configuration

The interactive launcher will prompt you to select your desired robot:
- `jetbot`, `create3`, `carter`, or `carter_ROS`

**Note:** For `carter_ROS`, make sure to unzip the `nova_carter_ros2_sensors` package located in `src/config/robots/`.

**Carter** robot also supports **ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2)** for autonomous navigation.

### 6. Launch the Simulation

Use the provided launcher script:

```bash
./launch_hunav_isaac.sh
```

This will:

- Start the interactive launcher with menu-driven configuration
- Guide you through selecting agent configuration, world, and robot model
- Load the specified world and spawn agents based on your selections
- Initialize physics, animations, and ROS 2 integration

### 7. Teleoperation and Navigation

#### Teleoperation

Use ROS 2 to publish Twist messages to `/cmd_vel` for direct robot control:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.1}}'
```

#### ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) ‚Äì Carter Robot Only

For autonomous navigation with the `carter_ROS` robot:

1. Ensure the simulation is running
2. In a separate terminal, launch the navigation stack:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch carter_navigation carter_navigation.launch.py \
     params_file:="src/config/navigation_params/carter_navigation_params.yaml" \
     map:="src/maps/warehouse.yaml"
   ```

## üîπ **Troubleshooting**
  
### Automated Setup Issues

If you encounter issues with the manual setup steps, you can use the automated setup script:

  ```bash
  # Make the script executable
  chmod +x setup_workspace.sh

  # Run the setup script
  ./setup_workspace.sh
  ```

This script will:

- Verify ROS2 is properly sourced
- Check for required dependencies (`hunav_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`, `std_msgs`, `nav_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`, `tf2_ros`)
- Automatically build the package if in a colcon workspace
- Provide guidance for workspace creation if needed
- Display usage examples for different launch methods

### ROS 2 Connectivity

Make sure that your ROS 2 Humble installation is sourced:

  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  ```

If `carter_navigation` package is not recognized, follow these steps:

1. Clone the [IsaacSim-ros_workspaces](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim-ros_workspaces.git) repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim-ros_workspaces.git
   ```

2. Build the ROS 2 humble workspace:

   ```bash
   cd IsaacSim-ros_workspaces/humble_ws
   colcon build
   ```

3. Source the workspace in your `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   source ~/IsaacSim-ros_workspaces/humble_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```

### Agent Configuration Issues

- If agents appear horizontal rather than vertical, adjust the rotation applied in the script (e.g., modify the quaternion calculation in `hunav_manager.initialize_agents()`'s `init_rot` parameter and/or `hunav_manager._update_agents()`).

### Retargeting Errors (*)

- Verify that the default source biped prim is correctly loaded at `/World/biped_demo`.
- Ensure that the target agents have a valid **skeleton** (use the `findSkeletonPath` method for debugging).
- Confirm that the extension `omni.anim.retarget.core` is enabled.

### AnimationGraph Issues

- If AnimationGraph is not applying correctly, verify that it is correctly assigned to the agent's **SkelRoot** and that transformations are applied properly.
